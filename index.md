# **wjk4**
this is, uh my site i guess. you could say there's some useful stuff. it's far from complete, that's one thing i can say about it. [here's the source code for this site](https://github.com/wjk4/wjk4.github.io)

# **Good OS's / Linux Distros**
 you could use normal windows.. but who does that?

**1. [AtlasOS](atlasos.net) - the main OS that i use. i would definetly recommend it.**
**2. [Fedora](getfedora.org) - a good daily driver linux distro
